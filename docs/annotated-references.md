The Demo by Google to help build custom Blockly blocks. Using this tool this will help us design some of the more complex Blockly blocks later down the line. At the very least we will be using this tool to figure out some of the syntax and help with our eventual transition to Python later down the line.

This is a link to the github used by Google's step by step tutorials for different things that can be created with Blockly. This can provide us examples for how to do some of the more specific things with Blockly, such as hooking it with an interface.
