About: ROMSly stands for Restaurant Order Management System and is implemented using Blockly. The idea is to create a general database system that will implement SQL style code into Blockly and then modify the database to prioritize the functionality necessary for managing orders in food sevice locales such as restaurants. Our motivation comes from personal experience with members of our team having worked in the industry and knowing of the grievances that come with having to record and keep track of numerous orders during busy rush times. The goal is to provide a way to transfer orders from servers and online orders to those in the kitchen more effectively reducing the chance of mixups and possible delays.
